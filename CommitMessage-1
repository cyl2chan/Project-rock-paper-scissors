delete:
    //go to 5. to test result
    const playerSelection = "rock";
    const computerSelection = getComputerChoice(arr);
    console.log(playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection));

When open window, it doesn't ask user to input rock, paper, or scissors

Advice from discord:

"So, I've finished. Let's view what is wrong step by step: 
1) arr has to be declared before getComputerChoice function
2) playerSelection has to be declared before playRound function
3) to call a function you should write its name with parentheses(with arguments inside if needed). 
4) in function game() you tried to call playRound() function before the loop, but it's wrong because you want to call this function inside the loop
5) also you need to move prompt inside of the loop because you want to ask the user's choice each round 
6) you declared 'result' variable but never used it 
7) you tried to handle case-sensitive inputs but overthink yourself. Instead, just use toLowerCase method for user input because you already use lowercase strings for the computer choice
8) function parameters are unnecessary in your code because you use global variables 
9) I think using 'else if' is not good for readability. Only 'if' is enough


This is how I fixed it (suggest you fix code by yourself first): https://codepen.io/Praesidi/pen/zYJqYVb?editors=0010 "

open r-p-s2.html
move "const arr = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'];" to 1st line within <script>
move "let playerSelection = prompt('Input "rock", "paper, or "scissors."');" from function game() to above case insensitivity
move function playRound inside of loop
add prompt into loop

comment out "const result = getComputerChoice(arr);"



come back to 3

2-28

remove logic of game running exactly 5 rounds
add 3 buttons

//continue DOM man. to add event listener

3-13

converting console.log into DOM methods

next: remove all regex stuff

3-14

no more error in console, but clicking buttons result in no repsonse
add divSingleResults with DOM method
test each step with console.log

console.log(getComputerChoice(arr)); --> correctly gives me rock, paper or scissors



console.log(playerSelection, 'player'); --> "player"
console.log(computerSelection, 'computer'); --> either "rock computer", "paper computer" or "scissors computer" when i refresh the window
