# Project-rock-paper-scissors-revisit

Last time I did the Rock Paper Scissors(RPS) project with the console version. This time I continue with this project, but doing it with the UI version with utilising DOM manipulation. 

RPS-revisit-1.html and RPS-revisit-1.js are my files from the first attempt.
RPS-revisit-Final.html and RPS-revisit-Final.js are my files from the second attempt. 

On first attempt, my project was not successful. I was adviced by the Odin Project community in discord to rewrite it. Another advice was to go back to my console version of the RPS project, where it works, and start from there. If I can build a RPS-console, then I can build a RSI-UI. It was frustrating and overwhelming. But I took a break, and had decided to stick to my project till the end. Then, I went back to my RPS-console, reviewed it, and made some modification.

After that, I started my second attempt on building my RPS-UI. With some help from the community, I finally complete my RPS-UI project!! The second attempt was not as hard as I thought.
